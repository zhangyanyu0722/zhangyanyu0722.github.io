Hi! Iâ€™m Yanyu Zhang, a current Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ee.ucr.edu/) and [Cooperative Vehicle Networks Laboratory (COVEN)](https://coven.engr.ucr.edu/), advised by Prof. [Wei Ren](https://intra.ece.ucr.edu/~ren/). My current research focuses on state estimation, visual-inertial odometry, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). 

Before I joined UCR, I received my M.S. from the Boston University (BU) [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/departments-and-divisions/electrical-and-computer-engineering/) in 2021, and my B.S. at the University of Detroit Mercy (UDM) [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.udmercy.edu/index.php) in 2019. At BU, I worked as research assistant at [BU Robotics Lab](https://sites.bu.edu/robotics/) and adviced by Prof. [John Baillieul](https://people.bu.edu/johnb/).
